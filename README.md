This is my first time reversing bss so functions may not be optimized

# Coding Style
Please stick to PascalCase for tables and camelCase for everything else.

For constants, please use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. 

Follow the general style of code - avoid nesting & look at other files to see how things are done.

Make OOP / class files the way which is shown in the codebase.

# Code Smell
A majority of the code will be very clean.

Some code will be especially ugly. The modules are there for rapid development. So, they are extremely smelly. A lot of mistakes were done during development.
